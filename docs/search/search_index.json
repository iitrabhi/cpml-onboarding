This document is designed to help new graduate students get started with our team. It covers the essential tools and formatting rules we use to ensure effective and efficient collaboration. Additionally, it provides recommended courses to familiarize yourself with the relevant terms and techniques. Prerequisites Before joining the team, please make sure you have covered the following prerequisites: Version Control If you are not familiar with Git and version control, please complete this Udacity course . Markdown For those new to Markdown, follow this tutorial . Drawing Curves Mastering bezier curves is essential for drawing figures and curves for papers. Complete the games at Bezier Method and aim for the optimum number of curves. LaTeX To quickly get up to speed with LaTeX, refer to this guide . Additionally, download our team template from <link> for paper submissions. Tools Our team utilizes several tools for different tasks: Veusz Download Veusz from here . The app includes an inbuilt tutorial for first-time users. Follow these guidelines for plotting: Left margin: 1.7 cm Right margin: 0.2 cm Top margin: 0.2 cm Bottom margin: 1.7 cm Width: 8 cm Height: 6 cm You may adjust the width to accommodate two figures on an A4 paper, considering the page margins. Affinity Designer Acquire Affinity Designer from here . This tool is used to create high-quality figures and add annotations to figures exported from finite element programs like ANSYS or ABAQUS. Obsidian Download Obsidian from here . Obsidian is a markup language editor that we use for note-taking and idea sharing. Additional Tools Automeris : Extract data from graphs in raster form. Remove.bg : Remove backgrounds from images. General Formatting Guidelines Font: cmu-serif Font Size: 10pt When writing mathematical equations with scalar variables, follow these guidelines: - Variables such as t, T, m, etc., are written in regular italic font (never bold, not even in a title). - Real numbers are written in regular font (never bold, never slanted). - Units such as m, s, m/s are written in regular font (never bold, never slanted). - Functions are written in regular font. - Matrices are written in bold font (never slanted). For example, \\( m \\) , \\( m \\) , and \\( m \\) are three different symbols. The first is a matrix, the second is a mass variable, and the third is the unit for length. Consider the following equation, which states that mass \\( m \\) is proportional to the length \\( a \\) , where \\( a \\) is in meters, the proportionality constant is 250.0, and the result is in kg: \\[ m = (250.0 \\, a \\, \\text{m}) \\, \\text{kg} \\] Never replace a lowercase letter in a unit with a capital (e.g., Kg instead of kg), as this would be incorrect and could imply a different meaning (e.g., Kelvin multiplied by gram). Academic Writing Ensure your writing meets the required standards by referring to the following resources: - Purdue OWL Graduate Writing - edX Academic Writing","title":"Onboarding Guidelines for CPML Lab"},{"location":"#onboarding-guidelines-for-cpml-lab","text":"","title":"Onboarding Guidelines for CPML Lab"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Welcome to the CPML Lab!
